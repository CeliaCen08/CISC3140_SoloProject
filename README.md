## Features
 
- 🗂 Browse every Pokémon TCG set via the PokéTCG API
- 🎴 Open booster packs with an authentic 10-card structure (Commons, Uncommons, Energy, Reverse Holo, and a Hit slot)
- ✨ Weighted rarity system — Double Rare, Illustration Rare, Ultra Rare, Special IR, and Hyper Rare
- 🖱 Click-to-reveal cards one by one
- 🔍 Click any revealed card to inspect it in a modal with full card details
- 💾 Collection persists across sessions via localStorage
- 🌸 Pastel-themed UI with smooth Framer Motion animations

## Tech Stack
 
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev) + [React](https://react.dev)
- [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) — card animations
- [PokéTCG API](https://pokemontcg.io) — real card data and images

## How It Works

1. **Card Data** (`src/data/cards.js`) — defines cards with name, type, rarity, and image URL (uses the PokéAPI sprites)
2. **Pack Logic** (`src/hooks/usePacks.js`) — weighted random draw: Common 60%, Uncommon 30%, Rare 9%, Holo 1%
3. **Pack Opener** (`src/components/PackOpener.jsx`) — shows the pack, triggers opening, reveals cards one by one
4. **Card Component** (`src/components/Card.jsx`) — flip animation on reveal using Framer Motion
5. **Collection** (`src/components/Collection.jsx`) — persists opened cards in localStorage

## Next Steps / Ideas

- [ ] Sound effects on card reveal
- [ ] Shiny/holo foil CSS effect on rare cards
- [ ] Trade duplicates feature
